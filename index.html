    <h2>Pyber Ride Sharing Data (2016)</h2>
    <p>The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, 
        you've decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of your own. In your latest capacity, 
        you'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, you'll be expected 
        to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.</p>
    <p>You've since been given access to the company's complete recordset of rides. This contains 
        information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, 
        driver count, individual fares, and city type.</p>
